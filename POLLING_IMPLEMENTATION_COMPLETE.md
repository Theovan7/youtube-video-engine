# Polling System Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Job Monitor Service** (`services/job_monitor.py`)
- Detects jobs stuck in "processing" state for more than 5 minutes
- Checks DigitalOcean Spaces for completed files using predictable URLs
- Automatically processes completed jobs and updates Airtable
- Handles different job types: combine, concatenate, add_music
- Marks very old jobs (>1 hour) as failed

### 2. **Automatic Polling Scheduler**
- Added to `app.py` using APScheduler
- Runs every 2 minutes by default (configurable)
- Starts automatically when the application launches
- Can be disabled via `POLLING_ENABLED=false` environment variable

### 3. **Manual Trigger Endpoint**
- `POST /api/v2/check-stuck-jobs`
- Allows immediate job checking without waiting for scheduled run
- Useful for testing and manual recovery

### 4. **Configuration**
Added to both development and production configs:
- `POLLING_ENABLED`: Enable/disable polling (default: true)
- `POLLING_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Check interval (default: 2)
- `POLLING_MAX_AGE_HOURS`: Max age before giving up (default: 24)

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: Every 2 minutes, the system queries Airtable for jobs in "processing" state older than 5 minutes

2. **Verification**: For each stuck job:
   - Constructs the expected DO Spaces URL: `https://phi-bucket.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/phi-bucket/{external_job_id}_output_0.mp4`
   - Checks if the file exists using HEAD request
   
3. **Recovery**: If file exists:
   - Updates the appropriate Airtable records (segments/videos)
   - Marks the job as completed
   - Logs the recovery

4. **Failure Handling**: If no file after 1 hour:
   - Marks job as failed
   - Prevents infinite checking

## Testing the System

### Manual Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://youtube-video-engine.fly.dev/api/v2/check-stuck-jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"older_than_minutes": 5}'
```

### Monitor Logs
```bash
fly logs --app youtube-video-engine | grep -i "job\|poll\|stuck"
```

## Expected Behavior

- Stuck jobs will be automatically recovered within 2-5 minutes if their output files exist
- No more "lost" jobs due to webhook failures
- Jobs that truly failed will be marked as such after 1 hour
- The system runs continuously in the background without manual intervention

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch logs to see how many jobs are recovered via polling
2. **Adjust Timing**: If needed, adjust `POLLING_INTERVAL_MINUTES` based on load
3. **Add Metrics**: Track webhook vs polling success rates
4. **Enhance Recovery**: Add support for alternative file patterns if needed

## Important Notes

- The polling system is a backup for webhook failures
- It does NOT replace webhooks - both systems work together
- Files must exist on DO Spaces for recovery to work
- Jobs without External Job IDs cannot be recovered automatically

The polling system is now live and will automatically recover stuck jobs going forward!
