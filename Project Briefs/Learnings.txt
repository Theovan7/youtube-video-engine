# 🚀 Complete Learnings Guide for Video Production Project Rebuild

## 📋 **Pre-Development Checklist**

### **1. External API Documentation**
- [ ] Verify ALL endpoint URLs with actual API calls, not just documentation
- [ ] Test response formats - don't assume, verify actual payloads
- [ ] Document webhook response structures from each service
- [ ] Check if APIs return sync vs async responses (or both!)
- [ ] Confirm required vs optional fields in API payloads

### **2. Environment Setup**
- [ ] Create `.env.example` with ALL required variables from day 1
- [ ] Implement startup validation for environment variables
- [ ] Use configuration constants file for all API endpoints
- [ ] Set up different configs for local/staging/production
- [ ] Document which services require which API keys

### **3. Airtable Structure Planning**
- [ ] Document all possible field name variations upfront
- [ ] Plan for flexible field detection from the start
- [ ] Understand Airtable attachment object structure
- [ ] Design for multiple naming conventions
- [ ] Test with real Airtable data before coding

## 🏗️ **Architecture Decisions**

### **1. Integration Strategy**
```python
# DON'T: Complex integration attempts
payload = {
    "inputs": [{"file_url": video_url, "options": [{"option": "-stream_loop", "argument": "-1"}]}],
    "outputs": [{"options": [{"option": "-c:v", "argument": "libx264"}]}]  # Complex, slow
}

# DO: Simple, proven patterns
payload = {
    "inputs": [{"file_url": video_url}, {"file_url": voiceover_url}],
    "outputs": [{
        "filename": "output.mp4",  # ALWAYS include filename
        "options": [
            {"option": "-c:v", "argument": "copy"},  # Fast, reliable
            {"option": "-shortest"}  # Standard behavior
        ]
    }]
}
```

### **2. Error Handling Architecture**
```python
# DO: Comprehensive error context from the start
class VideoProductionError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, error_type=None, details=None, job_id=None):
        self.message = message
        self.error_type = error_type
        self.details = details or {}
        self.job_id = job_id
        super().__init__(self.message)
```

### **3. Webhook Design Pattern**
```python
# DO: Flexible webhook handler that adapts to different response formats
def handle_webhook(data):
    # Check multiple possible status indicators
    status = None
    if 'status' in data:
        status = data['status']
    elif 'code' in data and 'message' in data:
        if data['code'] == 200 and data['message'].lower() == 'success':
            status = 'completed'
    
    # Log the entire payload for debugging
    logger.info(f"Webhook payload: {json.dumps(data, indent=2)}")
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Guidelines**

### **1. FFmpeg/Video Processing**
- **ALWAYS** include `filename` in output specifications
- Use `-c:v copy` for speed unless re-encoding is absolutely necessary
- Test with actual video files, not just assumptions
- Keep FFmpeg commands simple - complex options often fail
- Default to standard options like `-shortest`

### **2. Airtable Integration**
```python
# DO: Flexible field detection
def find_field_with_fallbacks(record, primary_field, fallback_fields):
    """Try multiple field names until one is found"""
    all_fields = [primary_field] + fallback_fields
    for field_name in all_fields:
        if field_name in record['fields'] and record['fields'][field_name]:
            logger.info(f"Found data in field: {field_name}")
            return record['fields'][field_name]
    
    # Log what was searched and what exists
    logger.error(f"No data found. Searched: {all_fields}")
    logger.error(f"Available fields: {list(record['fields'].keys())}")
    return None
```

### **3. File Upload Handling**
```python
# DO: Handle Airtable attachment structure properly
def extract_url_from_attachment(attachment_data):
    """Safely extract URL from Airtable attachment"""
    if isinstance(attachment_data, list) and attachment_data:
        if isinstance(attachment_data[0], dict) and 'url' in attachment_data[0]:
            return attachment_data[0]['url']
    elif isinstance(attachment_data, dict) and 'url' in attachment_data:
        return attachment_data['url']
    elif isinstance(attachment_data, str):
        return attachment_data
    return None
```

### **4. Async Job Handling**
- Always use correlation IDs (job_id) for tracking
- Implement timeout handling from the start
- Store job status in database for visibility
- Log state transitions comprehensively
- Handle both sync and async responses from APIs

## 📝 **Development Process**

### **1. Testing Strategy**
- Create test scripts for EVERY integration point
- Test the complete async flow, not just initial API calls
- Use production-like data from the beginning
- Test error cases as much as success cases
- Implement health check endpoints early

### **2. Deployment Strategy**
- Set up CI/CD from the start
- Use `--no-cache` deploys when debugging
- Monitor deployment state (machines running/stopped)
- Implement rolling deployments
- Add deployment verification scripts

### **3. Documentation Strategy**
- Document errors and fixes immediately
- Create troubleshooting guide as you go
- Include actual error messages in docs
- Document API response examples
- Keep a running list of "gotchas"

## 🚨 **Critical Mistakes to Avoid**

### **1. NCA Toolkit Specific**
- ❌ Don't use complex FFmpeg options without testing
- ❌ Don't assume endpoint URLs - verify them
- ❌ Don't forget the `filename` field in outputs
- ✅ Do use simple, proven payload formats
- ✅ Do test with actual API before implementing

### **2. Webhook Handling**
- ❌ Don't assume webhook payload format
- ❌ Don't skip webhook response logging
- ✅ Do handle multiple response format variations
- ✅ Do implement comprehensive webhook logging

### **3. Field Mapping**
- ❌ Don't hard-code field names
- ❌ Don't assume field structure
- ✅ Do implement flexible field detection
- ✅ Do log available vs searched fields

### **4. Feature Development**
- ❌ Don't add complex features without isolation testing
- ❌ Don't hesitate to revert breaking changes
- ✅ Do keep features simple and tested
- ✅ Do maintain working baseline functionality

## 🎯 **Implementation Priorities**

### **Phase 1: Foundation**
1. Environment configuration with validation
2. Logging infrastructure with correlation IDs
3. Error handling framework
4. Basic health check endpoints
5. Database schema with job tracking

### **Phase 2: Core Integrations**
1. Airtable connection with flexible field mapping
2. Simple file upload/download functionality
3. Basic webhook receivers with logging
4. Job status tracking system

### **Phase 3: External Services**
1. ElevenLabs integration (test with actual API)
2. NCA Toolkit integration (simple payloads only)
3. GoAPI integration (understand webhook patterns)
4. Each service thoroughly tested individually

### **Phase 4: Complex Features**
1. Video combination (keep FFmpeg simple)
2. Segment processing (handle arrays properly)
3. Music generation (timeout handling)
4. Only after all basics work perfectly

## 📊 **Monitoring & Debugging Setup**

### **1. Logging Requirements**
```python
# Comprehensive logging format
logger.info({
    'action': 'webhook_received',
    'job_id': job_id,
    'service': 'nca_toolkit',
    'payload': data,
    'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
})
```

### **2. Health Monitoring**
- Endpoint health checks for each service
- Job success/failure metrics
- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Webhook delivery tracking

### **3. Debugging Tools**
- Payload debugging scripts
- Test scripts for each endpoint
- Webhook payload inspector
- Field mapping analyzer
- Job status viewer

## 🔑 **Key Success Factors**

1. **Start Simple**: Basic working version before complex features
2. **Test Everything**: Every integration point needs a test script
3. **Log Extensively**: You can never have too much logging
4. **Document Immediately**: Write down issues as they happen
5. **Flexible Design**: Assume external APIs will be inconsistent
6. **Verify Don't Trust**: Test actual responses, not documentation
7. **Rollback Ready**: Keep working versions easy to restore
8. **Monitor Production**: Set up alerting from day one

## 💡 **Final Wisdom**

> "The best code is simple code that works reliably. Complex features that break integrations are worse than no features at all."

Remember: This project succeeded through persistence and careful troubleshooting. Your rebuild can avoid these issues by implementing these learnings from the start. Good luck! 🚀
