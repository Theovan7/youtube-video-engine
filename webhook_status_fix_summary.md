# YouTube Video Engine - Webhook Status Fix Summary

## Date: June 5, 2025

### Issue Fixed
The NCA webhook handler was failing to update Airtable Jobs table after successful operations due to using an invalid status value.

### Root Cause
- **File**: `/api/webhooks.py`
- **Line**: 290
- **Issue**: Hardcoded status value `'processed'` instead of using the configuration constant
- **Error**: Airtable API returned 422 - "Insufficient permissions to create new select option 'processed'"

### Solution Applied
Changed the status update from hardcoded string to configuration constant:

```python
# Before (INCORRECT):
airtable_job_updates = {'Status': 'processed', 'Error Message': None}

# After (CORRECT):
airtable_job_updates = {'Status': config.STATUS_COMPLETED, 'Error Message': None}
```

### Impact
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Affected Operations**: All successful NCA webhook callbacks
  - image_zoom (video generation from images)
  - combine (combining video with voiceover)
  - concatenate (combining multiple segments)
  - add_music (adding background music)

### Verification
- The fix has been verified through code inspection
- `config.STATUS_COMPLETED` correctly resolves to `'completed'`
- This is a valid status option in the Airtable Jobs table

### Next Steps
1. Deploy the fix to production immediately
2. Monitor webhook logs to confirm successful status updates
3. Check for any jobs stuck with incorrect status and update them manually
4. Review code for any other hardcoded status values
