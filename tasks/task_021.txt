# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive error handling system with retry logic for transient failures.
# Details:
1. Implement retry decorator for API calls:
   ```python
   import time
   from functools import wraps
   
   def retry(max_attempts=3, backoff_factor=1.5, exceptions=(Exception,)):
       def decorator(func):
           @wraps(func)
           def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
               attempt = 0
               while attempt < max_attempts:
                   try:
                       return func(*args, **kwargs)
                   except exceptions as e:
                       attempt += 1
                       if attempt == max_attempts:
                           raise
                       wait_time = backoff_factor ** attempt
                       logger.warning(
                           f"Retry {attempt}/{max_attempts} for {func.__name__} after {wait_time}s due to {str(e)}"
                       )
                       time.sleep(wait_time)
           return wrapper
       return decorator
   ```
2. Apply retry logic to all external API calls
3. Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing services
4. Create custom exception hierarchy for different error types
5. Add detailed error reporting and tracking

# Test Strategy:
Test retry logic with simulated failures. Verify correct number of retries and backoff timing. Test circuit breaker behavior. Verify different error types are handled appropriately. Test error reporting and tracking.
