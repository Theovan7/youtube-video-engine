# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with proper structure for a Flask-based API service, including Docker configuration for deployment to Fly.io.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository
2. Set up Python 3.11+ virtual environment
3. Create project structure:
   - app/
     - api/
     - models/
     - services/
     - utils/
     - webhooks/
   - tests/
   - config/
4. Initialize Flask application
5. Create requirements.txt with essential dependencies
6. Set up Docker configuration:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   COPY . .
   CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "app:app"]
   ```
7. Create fly.toml for Fly.io deployment
8. Set up .gitignore for Python projects

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure is complete and follows best practices. Ensure Docker container builds successfully and runs locally. Test basic Flask application startup.
