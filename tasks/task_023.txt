# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Fly.io Deployment Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Create deployment configuration for Fly.io to host the application in production.
# Details:
1. Create fly.toml configuration file:
   ```toml
   app = "youtube-video-engine"
   
   [build]
     dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
   
   [env]
     PORT = "8080"
   
   [http_service]
     internal_port = 8080
     force_https = true
     auto_stop_machines = true
     auto_start_machines = true
     min_machines_running = 1
     processes = ["app"]
   
   [[http_service.checks]]
     grace_period = "10s"
     interval = "30s"
     method = "GET"
     path = "/health"
     protocol = "http"
     timeout = "5s"
   ```
2. Configure secrets management for API keys
3. Set up environment-specific configurations
4. Configure scaling rules based on load
5. Set up monitoring and alerting

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment to a staging environment on Fly.io. Verify application starts correctly. Test scaling behavior. Verify secrets are correctly loaded. Test health check endpoint is working correctly. Verify HTTPS is enforced.
