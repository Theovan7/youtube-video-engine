## 🚨 CRITICAL PRINCIPLE FOR ALL FUNCTIONS

**"Do ONLY what the function name implies - nothing more!"**

Each function should have a single, focused responsibility:
- Process Script = Split script into segments
- Generate Voiceover = Generate voiceover audio
- Combine Segment Media = Combine voiceover with video
- No extra status tracking, no unnecessary field updates, no "helpful" additions

This keeps the system simple, maintainable, and predictable.

## 🔍 PROCESS SCRIPT FUNCTION - SIMPLIFIED REQUIREMENTS

### Webhook Input:
- Receives: Videos table record ID

### Fetch from Airtable:
- **ONLY** the `Video Script` field from Videos table

### Processing:
- Split script by newlines (`\n`)
- Filter out empty lines
- Calculate timing estimates for each segment (for voiceover use)

### Output:
- Create Segments records with:
  - SRT Segment ID (order number)
  - Videos (link to source record)
  - SRT Text (the segment text)
  - Start Time (calculated)
  - End Time (calculated)
  - Timestamps (SRT format)

**That's it!** No status updates, no segment counting, no video record modifications.

### What to REMOVE:
- Description/video_name fetching and usage
- Music_prompt fetching and usage  
- Target_segment_duration parameter and ALL duration-based segmentation logic
- Status updates to Videos table
- Processing timestamps on Videos table
- Segment count updates

- **Next Task Brief**: Access Airtable and manually add two linked fields to the Jobs table: 'Related Video' (Link to Videos table) and 'Related Segment' (Link to Segments table). This enables proper relationship tracking between jobs and their associated records.
- **Progress Update**: 2025-05-27 10:40 AM AWST - Investigated programmatic options for adding linked fields. Airtable base ID is stored in environment variables. Cannot access Airtable without base ID. REQUIRES USER ACTION: Manual configuration needed

### App General:

#### Webhook Architecture Refactoring
- **Status**: 📝 Planned - Architectural change required
- **Description**: For tasks that do not relate to a specific function but to the app in general
- **Next Task Brief**: CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE: All API functions must be refactored to accept Airtable webhook payloads containing only a record ID. Each function should: 1) Accept {"record_id": "recXXX"} payload, 2) Fetch record data from appropriate Airtable table, 3) Extract parameters from record, 4) Execute existing logic, 5) Update record with results. This enables Airtable automation triggers and centralizes all configuration in Airtable. See PROJECT_STATUS.md for detailed implementation guidelines.
- **Progress Update**: 2025-05-27 11:00 AM AWST - New architectural requirement documented. All functions need to be refactored from direct API endpoints to webhook receivers that work with Airtable automations.

3. **Test end-to-end pipeline** with deployed Process Script and webhook architecture
4. **Register webhook URL** in ElevenLabs dashboard (USER ACTION REQUIRED)
5. **Add linked fields** to Airtable Jobs table (USER ACTION REQUIRED)
6. **Deploy and test complete production pipeline**

## 🚨 NEW REQUIREMENT - WEBHOOK-BASED ARCHITECTURE:

### Requirement Overview:
All API functions must be refactored to work as webhook receivers that:
1. Accept a payload from Airtable automations containing only a record ID
2. Fetch the complete record data from Airtable using the provided record ID
3. Extract necessary parameters from the fetched record
4. Execute the existing function logic
5. Update the Airtable record with results (ONLY if necessary for the function)

### Current vs. Required Architecture:

**CURRENT (Direct API):**
```
POST /api/v1/process-script
{
  "script_text": "Your video script here...",
  "video_name": "My Video",
  "target_segment_duration": 30
}
```

**REQUIRED (Webhook-based):**
```
POST /api/v2/process-script
{
  "record_id": "recXXXXXXXX"
}
// Function fetches record from Airtable and extracts parameters
```

### Implementation Guidelines:

1. **Focused Functionality:**
   - Each function does ONLY what its name implies
   - No extra status tracking unless essential
   - No unnecessary field updates

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Return appropriate error if record_id is missing
   - Handle cases where record doesn't exist
   - Validate that record has required fields before processing

3. **Security:**
   - Validate webhook signatures from Airtable
   - Ensure record_id format is valid before fetching

### Benefits of This Architecture:
- All configuration managed in Airtable
- Easy to trigger via Airtable automations
- Simpler, more focused functions
- Centralized data management
