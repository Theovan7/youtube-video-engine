# YouTube Video Engine - Project Status

## âœ… What Has Been Done:

### Development (All 25 tasks completed):
1. **Project Setup & Infrastructure** - Flask API structure, Docker config, Fly.io setup
2. **Core Services** - Script processing, voiceover generation, video assembly
3. **Integrations** - Airtable, ElevenLabs, NCA Toolkit, GoAPI
4. **API Endpoints** - Complete video production pipeline endpoints
5. **Webhook System** - Handlers for all external services with signature validation
6. **Production Features** - Rate limiting, logging, error handling, health checks
7. **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, webhook tests
8. **Documentation** - API docs, architecture guide, configuration guide

### Deployment:
1. **GitHub Repository** - All code committed and pushed
   - Repository: https://github.com/Theovan7/youtube-video-engine.git
   - Latest commit: "Fix health check implementations for NCA and GoAPI services"

2. **Fly.io Deployment** - App successfully deployed
   - App URL: https://youtube-video-engine.fly.dev
   - Health endpoint: Fully functional (all services connected)
   - Latest deployment includes all service fixes

3. **Environment Variables** - All secrets configured in Fly.io
   - AIRTABLE_API_KEY âœ“
   - AIRTABLE_BASE_ID âœ“
   - Other required variables âœ“

## ðŸ”§ Current Issues:

### Service Connections:
1. **Airtable** - âœ… Connected
2. **ElevenLabs** - âœ… Connected (fixed with urllib3 update)
3. **GoAPI** - âœ… Connected (fixed missing GOAPI_BASE_URL and improved health check)
4. **NCA Toolkit** - âœ… Connected (fixed health check with proper x-api-key header)

### Health Status:
- Overall status: "healthy" (all services connected)
- Health checks: All passing

## ðŸ“‹ What Still Needs to Be Done:

### 1. âœ… Service Connection Issues - RESOLVED:
- [x] Investigated GoAPI connection error - Missing GOAPI_BASE_URL added
- [x] Investigated NCA Toolkit connection error - Fixed x-api-key header format
- [x] Verified API keys are correct and active
- [x] Tested actual API endpoints

### 2. Airtable Configuration:
- [x] Verify Airtable base structure
- [x] Videos table exists (with custom field names)
- [x] Segments table exists (with custom field names)
- [x] Jobs table created
- [x] Webhook Events table created
- [x] Updated code to match existing table schemas
- [ ] Add linked fields to Jobs table (Related Video, Related Segment) - Manual task

### 3. Production Testing:
- [ ] Test script processing endpoint
- [ ] Test voiceover generation
- [ ] Test video segment combination
- [ ] Test music generation
- [ ] Run full end-to-end video production test

### 4. Webhook Configuration:
- [ ] Register webhook URLs with external services
- [ ] Test webhook signatures
- [ ] Verify webhook endpoints are accessible

### 5. Monitoring & Operations:
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure error alerts
- [ ] Document operational procedures
- [ ] Create backup/recovery plan

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Priority**: Configure Airtable tables and structure
2. **Production Testing**: Run end-to-end video production test
3. **Webhook Configuration**: Register webhook URLs with external services
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure uptime monitoring and alerts
